i started my leetcode speedrun in 1 of august and i have done a course on algorithms 
and will finish up my data structurs course in C language in the coming week 
so i feel as per now i have the nessasry therotical knowledge to understand and solve questions 

there is a two liner that i wrote on the 1 of august 

Every Problem is easy untill you try to do it yourself
Every Problem is easy after you have tried and done it yourself 

august goal is to do min 4 lc hard 30 easy and 17 medium lets see(just rough numbers)
